# Show review tool
---

## Description
This could be a very useless tool for everybody else but me, I almost daily watch and review shows (mostly anime), and this is just a simple tool built primarily for my personal use.
A very simple application that accepts input in the format of information like setting up scores, and typing different review section, it's all based on the way I like to set off my reviews, and goes like following;

* Intro
* Story
* Art
* Sound
* Character
* Enjoyment
* Overall

After inputting all that needs to be inputted, the Overall score is updated automatically according to the other scores values. To export the results, you can simply do so via the `Export` option of the menu strip under the _File_ dropdown.

**Tip**
> Typing [title] (case sensitive) will have all of those occurrences auto replaced with the reviewed title name, another way to make your life easier.
